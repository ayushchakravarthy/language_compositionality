# PCFGSET compositionality tests

This folder contains the instantiations for the compositionality tests for PCFGSET.
The folder [pcfgset](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/pcfgset) contains the basic naturalised PCFGSET corpus, with which the task accuracy can be computed.

The folders [localism](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/localism), [productivity](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/productivity), [substitutivity](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/substitutivity) and [systematicity](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/systematicity) contain the data for the test with the corresponding name.
If in the paper for a particular test we conducted auxiliary tests, the data for those tests can be found in the folder of this test.

If you would like to generate other PCFG SET datasets yourself, or you would like to know more about the generation process, check the [PCFG SET generation repository](https://github.com/MathijsMul/pcfg-set).
